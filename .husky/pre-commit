# This pre-commit script performs a basic check of whether the generated files (in the dist/ directory)
# need to be regenerated. If they do, it probably means that the committer has forgotten to regenerate
# the dist/* files after making changes.
# A more accurate test is performed by the check-dist GitHub workflow, which rebuilds the generated
# files and compares them to the committed versions. This would be too expensive to perform on every
# commit, so we just do a simple test to prevent silly mistakes caused by forgetfulness.
