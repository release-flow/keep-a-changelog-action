# `dist/**/index.js` are special files in Actions.
# When you reference an action with `uses:` in a workflow,
# `index.js` is the code that will run.
# For our project, we generate these files through a build process from other source files.
# We need to make sure the checked-in `index.js` files actually match what we expect them to be.
